Preparation

create _deploy subdir which is mapped to repo:gh-pages

1) Make changes

To create a new blog post, do:
bundle exec rake new_post["Blog migration from funwithbits.net"]

2) 
bundle exec rake generate
bundle exec rake deploy

Latter will write into _deploy and generate a commit automatically

3) Push changes from _deploy into repo:gh-pages.
